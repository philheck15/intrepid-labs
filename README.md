Documentation from the landing page for Intrepid Labs. Initially Intrepid Pursuit wanted to have a web presence for their space-sharing mobile community. Talking with the client it turned out that they wanted a blog, as well as providing a virtual tour of the place and a good representation of the services that were offered. Wordpress seemed to be the way to go and a parallax theme was to offer some pizzaz. We developed a marketing and sale strategy along with original icons and used photography from the space for the landing page.
